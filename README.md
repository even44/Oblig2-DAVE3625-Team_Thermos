WHY (LINEAR) REGRESSION?

The choice to use a regression-algorithm versus a classification-algorithm is that we want to get a prediction on a price, which is a numeric value. A classification-algorithm would not let us achieve this as itÂ´s functionality would be either categorizing data based on the likelihood of it belonging to a certain category. One thing a classification-algorithm could do for us is give us a binary answer to a question on wether a stock would be higher or lower than a certain price at a certain time, but this is not what we are aiming for in this task.
